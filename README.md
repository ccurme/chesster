# ♟️ Chesster

Chesster is a conversational AI Chess teacher. Given a [PGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) dump of a game or sequence of moves, Chesster will walk you through interesting moments, highlight successes and mistakes, and simulate alternate scenarios.

Chesster will also attend as you play a game against the computer (currently the [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) engine), answering questions and identifying opportunities to learn.
